<!-- This is an Angular code snippet that is using structural directives to conditionally render a div
element and its child anchor elements. The `*ngIf` directive is checking if the `tags` variable is
truthy, and if it is, the div and its child anchor elements will be rendered. The `*ngFor` directive
is looping through each `tag` in the `tags` array and creating an anchor element for each one. The
`routerLink` attribute is binding the URL path to the tag name, and the
`{{tag.name}}({{tag.count}})` expression is displaying the tag name and its count in parentheses. -->
<div *ngIf="tags">
  <a *ngFor="let tag of tags" routerLink="/tag/{{ tag.name }}">
    {{ tag.name }}({{ tag.count }})
  </a>
</div>
