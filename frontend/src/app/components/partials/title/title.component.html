<!-- This is an HTML code block that is using Angular's `ngStyle` directive to dynamically apply styles
to the `h1` element. The styles being applied are `margin` and `fontSize`, which are variables
defined in the component's TypeScript code. The `title` variable is also being interpolated into the
`h1` element's text content. -->
<h1 [ngStyle]="{ margin: margin, fontSize: fontSize }">
  {{ title }}
</h1>
