# MY SNACK BAR WITH BACKEND - SNACK SHACK

## Description

This is the second iteration of the my snack bar. The goal of this project is to create a website for a fictional restaurant. The website should be responsive and accessible. The website is built using Angular and TypeScript for the frontend and uses express for the backend!.
The website is built using the atomic design approach. - The atomic design approach is a methodology for creating design systems. It involves breaking down a design into its smallest parts (atoms) and then combining them to form larger, reusable components.

- HTML
